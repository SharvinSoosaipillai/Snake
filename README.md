# Snake
This is a recreation of the game snake made developed for my 2SH4 final project using an Object Oriented Model and meant to be played in the command line terminal.

# Installation
To play this game you must first download the repository using
`git clone https://github.com/SharvinSoosaipillai/Snake.git`

From there, move into the snake directory using
`cd snake`

and run the Make file
`make`

Finally, to run the project run the following command
`./project.exe`

Use `w,a,s,d` to move around and collect all of the `X`.
Collect the `=` and `+` for a special surprise!
